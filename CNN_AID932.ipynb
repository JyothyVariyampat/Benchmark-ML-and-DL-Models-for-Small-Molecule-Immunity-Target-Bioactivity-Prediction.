        "Interpretation: This indicates that your model is able to correctly classify 90.62% of the samples in the training set. A high training accuracy suggests that the model has learned well on the training data. However, if the training accuracy is significantly higher than the test accuracy, it might indicate overfitting.\n",
        "2. Test Accuracy: 0.7825 (78.25%)\n",
        "Interpretation: This is the overall accuracy on the test dataset. It means that 78.25% of the test samples were classified correctly. While this is lower than the training accuracy, it’s still reasonably high. The difference between training and test accuracy indicates some level of overfitting, but not extreme.\n",
        "3. ROC-AUC Score: 0.8674\n",
        "Interpretation: The ROC-AUC score measures the ability of the model to distinguish between the positive and negative classes. A score of 0.8674 is good (close to 1), indicating that the model has a strong capability of differentiating between active and inactive classes in the test data. This is a positive sign of the model's performance.\n",

        "Interpretation: The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It balances the trade-off between these two metrics:\n",
        "A score of 0.7868 suggests that the model's precision and recall are balanced well.\n",
        "It indicates a strong overall performance, especially in scenarios where the dataset might be imbalanced.\n",
        "5. Cohen’s Kappa: 0.5673\n",
        "Interpretation: Cohen's Kappa measures the agreement between predicted and actual classifications while accounting for the possibility of agreement by chance.\n",
        "A Kappa score of 0.5673 indicates moderate agreement between the predictions and the true labels.\n",
        "It suggests that while the model performs well, there is still some room for improvement in the consistency of predictions.\n",
        "6. Precision: 0.7329\n",
        "Interpretation: Precision indicates the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions made by the model.\n",
        "A precision of 0.7329 means that when the model predicts a sample as \"active,\" it is correct about 73.29% of the time.\n",
        "This shows that the model has a relatively low rate of false positives.\n",
        "7. Recall: 0.8492\n",
        "Interpretation: Recall (or Sensitivity) measures the proportion of actual positive cases that were correctly identified by the model.\n",
        "A recall score of 0.8492 means that the model correctly identifies 84.92% of the actual active samples.\n",
        "This high recall suggests that the model is good at capturing the majority of positive (active) cases, minimizing false negatives.\n",
        "Summary and Recommendations:\n",
        "The model shows strong performance, with good training and test accuracy, high ROC-AUC, and a balanced F1 score.\n",
        "The difference between training (90.62%) and test accuracy (78.25%) suggests a bit of overfitting. You might consider techniques such as:\n",
        "Adding regularization (e.g., L2 regularization or dropout).\n",
        "Collecting more data if possible or applying data augmentation techniques.\n",
        "Using early stopping to prevent overfitting during training.\n",
        "The relatively high ROC-AUC and recall scores indicate that the model is effective at distinguishing between the two classes and minimizing false negatives, which is often important in classification tasks related to drug discovery (e.g., detecting active compounds).\n",
        "The moderate Cohen’s Kappa score (0.5673) suggests room for improvement in the model’s agreement with the ground truth, potentially by further optimizing hyperparameters."
